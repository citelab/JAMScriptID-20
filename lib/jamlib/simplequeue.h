 * Implementation idea is very simple. Just use a nano message pipeline.
 * Stick the messages into the pipeline when enqueuing. Dequeue from the pipeline
 * itself. The thread that is trying to dequeue from the pipeline will get stuck
 * if thedfdsfdfre is no items in the pipeline.

 * The cool thing with this implementation is that it could be used with threads
 * without threads .. with the threadless "select-based" approach. Just watch the
 * pipeline using a select.
